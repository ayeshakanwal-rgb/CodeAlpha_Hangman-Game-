## CodeAlpha_Hangman Game
This is my Hangman Game project for the CodeAlpha Internship (Python Programming domain).

## Description
This is a simple **text-based Hangman game** implemented in Python.  
The player guesses a word one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses.  

It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to practice basic Python concepts like:

- `random` module  
- `while` loops  
- `if-else` statements  
- Strings and lists  
- Basic console input/output

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will be able to:

1. Understand how to **use lists and strings** to store and manipulate data.  
2. Apply **loops and conditional statements** to control program flow.  
3. Use the **`random` module** to select random elements.  
4. Implement **basic user input and output** in Python.  
5. Develop **problem-solving skills** by breaking down the Hangman game logic.  
6. Learn **incremental debugging and testing** of a simple program.  

## How to Play
1. Run the `.py` file in Python.  
2. The program will randomly select a word from a small predefined list.  
3. The word will be displayed as underscores (`_`) representing each letter.  
4. You have **6 lives**. Each wrong guess will reduce one life.  
5. Guess one letter at a time by typing it and pressing **Enter**.  
6. The game ends when either:
   - You guess all letters correctly (**You Win!**)  
   - You run out of lives (**Game Over!**)  


## Predefined Word List
- apple  
- banana  
- orange  
- grape  
- mango
